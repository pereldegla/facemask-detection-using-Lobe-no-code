Lobe is a free, private desktop application that has everything to take machine learning ideas from prototype to production.
No code is involved until the evaluation phase. Lobe also provides a skeleton code to use the model
- Labelling examples
- Training a model
- Evaluating training results
- Playing with a model
- Exporting and using a model in an app or different formats

The model used was generated using Lobe image classification. 
This can be paired with a face detection algorithm then classifying multiple faces in the image.
Here is an example: 
<img src= alt="alt text" width=350 height=350>
