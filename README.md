The model used was generated using Lobe image classification. 
This can be paired with a face detection algorithm then classifying multiple faces in the image.
"example" folder was generated at the end of the process. 
Check README for guidelines

Here is a result: 

```python tf_example.py test-img```

This model has 98% accuracy.

Lobe is a free, private desktop application that has everything to take machine learning ideas from prototype to production.
No code is involved until the evaluation phase. Lobe also provides a skeleton code to use the model.
